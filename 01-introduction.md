# Nextflow 
This tutorial aims to get you familiarized with Nextflow. After this course you should be able to understand workflow pipelines that are written in Nextflow and write simple pipelines yourself! Here's an overview of the materials that we will cover:

- General introduction to Nextflow 
- Basic concepts: processes, channels and operators
- Creating our first Nextflow script(s)
- Managing configurations: parameters, portability, execution
- Creatin reports

After a brief introduction and example in DSL1, we will immediately change to the newer version of Nextflow with DSL2. It's important to have an idea of the differences between the two versions as most of the pipelines today are written in DSL1, but being transformed or enriched with new pipelines written in DSL2.
